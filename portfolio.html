        <h3>IMF lending</h3>
        <p>The first chart examines IMF lending from 1984 to 2022 and replicates one found in the FT</p>

        <h3>IMF Lending as a % of World Real GDP</h3>
        <p>The second chart adjusts upon the previous examining IMF lending as a % of World Real GDP from 1984 to 2022</p>
        <p>Upon transforming the data, it appears the most 'risky' year would be 1985. Outstanding credit in 1985 peaked at 0.38% of World GDP.</p>
